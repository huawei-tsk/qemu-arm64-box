Bootstrapping Aarch64
======================

This repositories will track my attempts to familiarize myself with the ARMv8-A
architecture in Aarch64 mode.

It will hopefully evolve over time and initialize more and more parts of the
system.

## Requirements

You will need:
 * `aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc` et al.
 * `qemu-system-aarch64`
 * `make`


## Run it

To run the code, just type:

~~~bash
$ make qemu
~~~
